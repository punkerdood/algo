This is Studio 1.  
1.Given the un-reduced big-O value, calculate the reduced value.
  a. 1
  b. n
  c. n^2
  d. Log n
  
2. For each of the following algorithms, calculate the big-O value. 
  Be sure to specify which value n refers to.
    a. Reversing a string
        n = c
    b. Printing out a matrix
        n^2 = (row_idx)(col_idx)
    c.  Reversing each string in an array.
        1 = c
        
 3. Suppose you have an array of Customer objects, sorted in alphabetical order by last name. 
   For each of the following tasks, determine the run time in terms of big-O.
   a. n
   b. log(n)
   c. log(n)
   d. n
 
 4. Now suppose that you have a dictionary (or hash map) of customer objects, 
 where the keys are letters and the values are arrays storing all customers with 
 last name beginning with that letter.
   a. n
   b. n
   c. n
   d. n^2
